What is the output from the following code. Note that we did not cover all of
 these techniques in class, so you might need to do some exploration on your
 own.

def hmmm( x ):
    if x[0] > x[1]:
        return (x[1], x[0])
    else:
        return x

s = ('a', 'b')
t = (1, 2, 3)
u = (4, 5, 2)
print( t[1] + u[0] )
print( t+u )
print( s[1] * t[2] )
print( hmmm(u) )
print( hmmm( (5, 2, 3) ))
"""

"""
1. t[1] equals 2 and u[0] equals 4, so t[1] + u[0] = 4 + 2 = 6
2. t is (1, 2, 3) and u is (4, 5, 2); this line combines the tuples, so the
    result is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2)
3. s[1] is the string 'b' and t[2] equals 3; the string is iterated 3 times,
    so the result is bbb
4. the tuple u is put into the user-defined function hmmm(); it states that if
    x[0] (which in this case is 4) is greater than x[1] (5 in this case) then
    it will return (x[1], x[0]) (5, 4); however, this is not the case, so the
    function will return the unaltered tuple (4, 5, 2)
5. the tuple (5, 2, 3) goes into the function hmm(); in this case, x[0] > x[1]
    (5 > 2), so the function will return x[1], x[0] which is (2, 5)
