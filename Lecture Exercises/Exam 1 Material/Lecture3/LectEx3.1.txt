Which of the following are valid strings? Upload a text file to Submitty that
contains just the variable names that are assigned to strings that are correct.
For example if only the first two were correct your file would contain s0 on
the first line and s1 on the second. Please use the editor in the Spyder IDE
to generate the file. Do not use Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or other document
editors. They embed extra characters in the text that will make your answer
incorrect.

>>> s0 = "Sheldon Cooper's apartment is in Pasedena"

>>> s1 = 'This cheese shop's cheese is all gone"

>>> s2 = """We are
"The Knights of the Round Table"
"""

>>> s3 = "Toto, I said,\n"We aren't in Kansas, anymore!"


>>> s4 = 'Have you seen the "Final Five"'s picture?'


>>> s5 = "Have you seen the 'Final Five''s picture?"
