Your problem is to determine the output of the Python program shown below. You
must submit a text file showing the output. (Hint: there should be two lines
with one integer on each line.) While it is possible to just run the program
and copy the output, we strongly encourage you to not do this. You need to
develop the ability to read code and understand what it will do. You will be
tested on it.

z = 2
z = z**2**3
print(z)
x = 6
x = x**2 + 6 - z // 10 * 2
print(x)
"""

The variable z has the integer value 2 stored in it.
In the following line, z has exponent values attached to it; first, 2 will go
to th power of 3, which results in 8. z will then go to the power of 8, which
results in 256 since 2**8 = 256.
The updated variable z is then printed in the next line.

The variable x has the integer value 6 stord in it.
In the followig line, x is put into an equation that features z which we know
to be 2.
First, x will go to the power of 2 to become 36 since 6**2 = 36; then, z,
which now equals 256, goes through integer division by 10, resulting in 25;
25 is then multiplied by 2 to get 50; putting it all together, 36 + 6 - 50
equals -8.

Output:
256
-8
