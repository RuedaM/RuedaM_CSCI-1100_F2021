1. What is the output of the following Python code? Write the answer by hand
    before you type it into the Python interpreter. One thing that will be
    hard to guess is the order of the sets, especially when the set mixes
    integers and strings. Therefore, you pretty much have to run the code to
    make sure you have the order right. (At the moment, our use of Submitty is
    not sophisticated enough to allow random order.) This means you get the
    points almost for free, but you should make the effort to be sure you
    understand what is happening.

s1 = set([0,1,2])
s2 = set(range(1,9,2))
print('A:', s1.union(s2))

print('B:', s1)

s1.add('1')
s1.add(0)
s1.add('3')
s3 = s1 | s2
print('C:', s3)

print('D:', s3 - s1)

    Note that this example does NOT cover all of the possible set operations.
    You should generate and test your own examples to ensure that you
    understand all of the basic set operations.

A: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
B: {0, 1, 2}
C: {0, 1, 2, '1', 3, 5, 7, '3'}
D: {3, 5, 7}
