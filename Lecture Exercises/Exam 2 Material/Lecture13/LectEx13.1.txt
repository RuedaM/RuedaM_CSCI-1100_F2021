1. The intereactions and behaviors of file input with strip(), split(), and
    the \n character are not always intuitive. Given the file census_data.txt
    that can be downloaded from the Course Materials tab in the Lecture Notes
    folder:

Line 1 |Location    2000    2011
Line 2 |New York State  18,976,811  19,378,102
Line 3 |New York City   8,008,686   8,175,133
Line 4 |

    What is the output of the following code? (Note: the line numbers and the “|”
     are not actually in the file, they are just there to show how the file
     will look in the Spyder editor.)

f = open("census_data.txt")
line1 = f.readline()
line1 = line1.strip()
line2 = f.read()
line3 = f.readline()
print(line1)
print(line2)
print(line3)
f.close()
f = open("census_data.txt")
s = f.read()
line_list = s.split('\n')
print(len(line_list))
line_list = s.strip().split('\n')
print(len(line_list))

    Submit your output as a text file.
