3. The solution to this problem and the two that follow should start with the
    assignment:

co2_levels = [ 320.03, 322.16, 328.07, 333.91, 341.47, \
               348.92, 357.29, 363.77, 371.51, 382.47, 392.95 ]

    Write a Python program that prints the number of values that are greater
    than the average of the list. For this you may use Pythonâ€™s sum and len
    functions and you must use a for loop. Do NOT use a range, however, and do
    not use indexing.
   Your output should simply be:

Average: 351.14
Num above average: 5

co2_levels = [ 320.03, 322.16, 328.07, 333.91, 341.47, \
               348.92, 357.29, 363.77, 371.51, 382.47, 392.95 ]

avg = (sum(co2_levels) / len(co2_levels))
print("Average: {0:.2f}".format(avg))

NumAboveAvg = 0
for value in co2_levels:
    if value > avg:
        NumAboveAvg += 1

print("Num above average:", NumAboveAvg)
