1. The following simple exercise will help you understand loops better. Show
    the output of each of the following pairs of for loops. The first two
    pairs are nested loops, and the third pair is formed by consecutive, or
    sequential, loops. Submit a single text file containing three lines, each
    with an integer on it.

# Version 1
total = 0
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        total += 1
print(total)

# Version 2
total = 0
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(i+1,10):
        total += 1
print(total)

# Version 3
total = 0
for i in range(10):
    total += 1
for j in range(10):
    total += 1
print(total)
