Archery Club|Activities include shooting two times a week Tuesday and Thursday 7-9pm in the basement of the Armory. We have equipment for people to use, but you are welcome to bring your own. Longbows, Recurves, Compounds, and Crossbows are all welcome. We have a coach, Mark Myers, and are currently working on a team to go to competitions. Questions? Contact Marcus at rohovm@rpi.edu
